#CT300:  FULL-STACK IMMERSIVE

##THE COURSE
--------------
Code Tahoe’s 11-week immersive is designed to give students the full range of knowledge and skills to build full-stack web applications.  We begin with a complete, ground-up overview of the internet and the underlying web technologies that power it.  From there we will cover computer science fundamentals ranging from design patterns to database architecture.  Once our students are fully-armed with the core understanding of the “what,” then we proceed to the “how” - building complete, functional web applications using the most popular, effective tools.

We strive to instill a solid foundation of programming knowledge, experience with specific languages and frameworks, and the vision and confidence to embrace new technologies in a fast-moving and ever-changing industry.
Our primary goal is to train our students to have a successful career in tech.  Graduates leave Code Tahoe with a body of work they can use in their job search to discuss and demonstrate what they are capable of contributing to a company.

Students will complete the full curriculum so that they will be able to:

- Learn & practice agile development workflow and collaborate using Git
- Develop web applications using both Ruby and JavaScript
- Create responsive designs using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Design & deploy both SQL and NoSQL databases
- Work with internal and external APIs
- Use common JavaScript frameworks, such as React and Angular
- Develop full-stack web applications using common design patterns
- Set up and deploy to cloud-based hosting solutions
- Create clear and concise documentation of their projects
